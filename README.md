# Usable Overview

## Introduction

A neat small extension that enhance your workflow, making the overview actually usable.

## The Issue

GNOME 40 was out.
Surely it's no doubt a wonderful release, however I *do* think something is just not right.
Sometimes I don't feel like putting my hands on the keyboard, using only mouse to navigate around.
Now here comes the issue:

To enter the overview, the cursor should move all the way up left to trigger the hot corner.
However, to enter the apps grid, the cursor should move all the way down to the screen bottom then click the "Show Apps" button.

The experience is just plain **frustrating** to say the least.
In the GNOME 3.x era, it was *somewhat* bearable since the button was just on the left side.
What's even worse, it's **impossible** to build up muscle memory.
Because, once an app is opened, the app icon in the dash just push the button to the right.

## The Solution

The desired behavior is entering the apps grid without headache.
When right clicked on the "Activities" button, it just brings up the apps grid.
Simple and Straightforward.
