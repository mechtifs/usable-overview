# Usable Overview

## Introduction

A simple extension for GNOME Shell. 
  
When it comes to mouse-only navigation, the default gnome workflow really sucks, 
especially on GNOME 40+ (which means if you would like to open the application grid, 
you need to first activate the top-left hot corner then move your cursor all the way down to the screen bottom and click that stinky botton, 
even worse than it used to be on GNOME 3.x)
  
Thus, I created this extension to make the overal experience way more comfortable. You just need to activate the top-left hot corner, 
then simply hit the right button on your mouse and everything rocks
